I started thinking the other day, I don't have any Olympic medals, I wonder who else doesn't.

This makes a graph of countries that don't have any Olympic medals according to wikipedia
as of the 2024 Paris Olympics. Skips many small nations due to map limitations.

Download data through download-data.ipynb. Graph it in no-olympic-medals.ipynb
